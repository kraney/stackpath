type DeliveryConnectScopeToOriginRequest struct {
	Origin DeliveryConnectScopeToOriginRequestOrigin `json:"origin,omitempty"`
	// The origin's priority to the scope  If more than one origin powers a CDN scope, then the one with the lower priority number takes higher precedence. When there is an origin already in place, the following rules are followed:  - If an origin ID is provided, then the current origin at that priority is disconnected in favor of the new one. - If an origin is provided and the current origin at the given priority is dedicated, then the origin is updated in place. - If an origin is provided and no dedicated origin exists, the origin is created and connected to the scope.
	Priority int32 `json:"priority,omitempty"`
	// The ID of an existing origin to associate with a scope  This is useful for connecting to a shared origin.
	OriginId string `json:"originId,omitempty"`
