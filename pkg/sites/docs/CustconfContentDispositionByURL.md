## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Id** | **string** | This is used by the API to perform conflict checking | [optional] 
**DispositionNameQSParam** | **string** | This is the name of the query string parameter which contains the file name to use in the Content-Disposition header. This setting is typically used by customers to configure a \&quot;friendly name\&quot; for URLs that have obfuscated file names. | [optional] 
**DispositionTypeQSParam** | **string** | This is the name of the query string parameter which contains the disposition type to use in the Content-Disposition header. Typically, this value is set to attachment if you want the browser to present the user with a \&quot;File Download\&quot; dialog box and set to inline if you want the browser to render the content inline (play an audio/video file instead of downloading it). | [optional] 
**DispositionOverrideQSParam** | **string** | This setting allows you to define a query string parameter that when present in the URL contains a string that should be used for the Content-Disposition header. The string specified in the URL will completely replace the value the CDN would have used based on other policies defined for the Content-Disposition header. | [optional] 
**OverrideOriginHeader** | **bool** | This setting allows you to force the Content-Disposition generated by the CDN for this policy to override the Content-Disposition header cached from your origin. | [optional]
