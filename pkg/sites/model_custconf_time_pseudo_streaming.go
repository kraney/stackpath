// CustconfTimePseudoStreaming The HTTP pseudo-streaming policy enables Flash based video players to support seeking to random locations within a MP4 or FLV file without having to download the entire video. Flash players such as Flowplayer and JWPlayer can be configured to send a query string parameter that indicates to the server the time offset the user advanced the video to. Typically a query string parameter called \"start\" is used by these players.
type CustconfTimePseudoStreaming struct {
	// This is used by the API to perform conflict checking
	Id string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// The name of the query string parameter that indicates to the CDN the specific time interval of the video that is being requested.
	JumpToTimeStartParam string `json:"jumpToTimeStartParam,omitempty"`
	// The name of the query string parameter that indicates to the CDN the end time of the video that should be returned.
	JumpToTimeEndParam string `json:"jumpToTimeEndParam,omitempty"`
	Enabled bool `json:"enabled,omitempty"`
}
