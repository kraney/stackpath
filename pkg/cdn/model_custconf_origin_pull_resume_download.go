package cdn
// CustconfOriginPullResumeDownload The CDN attempts to resume downloading Origin Pulls once it successfully reads all the headers of a positive response under certain conditions by sending subsequent origin range requests for the remaining body. The response must be a 2xx to a GET request for the full file or a single range (not multi-range). The response must contain the Last-Modified and ETag headers.
type CustconfOriginPullResumeDownload struct {
	// This is used by the API to perform conflict checking
	Id string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	Enabled bool `json:"enabled,omitempty"`
	// String of values delimited by a ',' character. Comma separated list of glob patterns that indicate which origin pulls this policy applies to based on the status code of the original origin response. This feature is limited to 2xx responses, but this policy provides fine control, such as permitting resume of 200 responses by not 206, or for adding a 2xx response code other than 200 or 206.
	OriginalStatusCodeMatch string `json:"originalStatusCodeMatch,omitempty"`
	// Minimum number of body bytes that CDN must have consumed during an Origin Pull before encountering an error before it is permitted to attempt resuming the download. This value does not include the headers bytes.
	MinimumBodyBytesConsumed string `json:"minimumBodyBytesConsumed,omitempty"`
	// Maximum number of times beyond the initial request that the CDN is permitted to attempt resuming an Origin Pull download.
	MaximumAttempts float32 `json:"maximumAttempts,omitempty"`
	// The CDN resumes an Origin Pull even if the origin does not support range requests. If the origin does not support range requests and/or returns a 200 response for the same version given in the original response, the CDN fast-forwards (reads and discards bytes) until it reaches its previous position in the asset.
	RequireOriginRangeSupport bool `json:"requireOriginRangeSupport,omitempty"`
	EtagValidation OriginPullResumeDownloadEtagValidationEnumWrapperValue `json:"etagValidation,omitempty"`
	// String of values delimited by a ',' character.
	HeaderFilter string `json:"headerFilter,omitempty"`
	// String of values delimited by a ',' character.
	PathFilter string `json:"pathFilter,omitempty"`
